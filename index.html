                <h2>About Homer's Life</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>Homer Jay Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge, and father to Bart, Lisa and Maggie
                        Simpson.[1]
                        He is the son of Mona and Abraham "Grampa" Simpson. Homer held over 188 different jobs in the
                        first
                        400 episodes of The Simpsons.[2] In most episodes, he works as the nuclear safety inspector at
                        the
                        Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position which he has held since "Homer's Odyssey", the third
                        episode of the series, despite the fact that he is totally unsuitable for it.[3] At the nuclear
                        plant, Homer is often ignored and completely forgotten by his boss Mr. Burns, and he constantly
                        falls asleep and neglects his duties. Matt Groening has stated that he decided to have Homer
                        work at
                        the power plant because of the potential for Homer to wreak severe havoc.[4] Each of his other
                        jobs
                        has lasted only one episode. In the first half of the series, the writers developed an
                        explanation
                        about how he got fired from the plant and was then rehired in every episode. In later episodes,
                        he
                        often began a new job on impulse, without any mention of his regular employment.[5]

                        The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters never physically age, and, as
                        such,
                        the show is generally assumed to be always set in the current year. Nevertheless, in several
                        episodes, events in Homer's life have been linked to specific time periods.[1] "Mother Simpson"
                        (season seven, 1995) depicts Homer's mother, Mona, as a radical who went into hiding in 1969
                        following a run-in with the law;[6] "The Way We Was" (season two, 1991) shows Homer falling in
                        love
                        with Marge Bouvier as a senior at Springfield High School in 1974;[7] and "I Married Marge"
                        (season
                        three, 1991) implies that Marge became pregnant with Bart in 1980.[8] However, the episode "That
                        '90s Show" (season 19, 2008) contradicted much of this backstory, portraying Homer and Marge as
                        a
                        twentysomething childless couple in the early 1990s.[9]

                        Due to the floating timeline, Homer's age has changed occasionally as the series developed; he
                        was
                        34 in the early episodes,[7] 36 in season four,[10] 38 and 39 in season eight,[11] and 40 in the
                        eighteenth season,[12] although even in those seasons his age is inconsistent.[1] In the fourth
                        season episode "Duffless", Homer's drivers license shows his birthdate of being May 12,
                        1956,[13]
                        which would have made him 36 years old at the time of the episode. During Bill Oakley and Josh
                        Weinstein's period as showrunners, they found that as they aged, Homer seemed to become older
                        too,
                        so they increased his age to 38. His height is 6' (1.83 m).[14]
